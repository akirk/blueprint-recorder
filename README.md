# Expose WordPress Playground Blueprint

This plugin exposes the WordPress Playground Blueprint for the current site so that it can be loaded using the WordPress Playground:

https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://URL/wp-json/playground/v1/blueprint

**Warning:** This plugin will also log most INSERT and UPDATE statements, so it is currently only intended to be used inside Playground itself. It can be used to receive a blueprint of an already configured playground.
